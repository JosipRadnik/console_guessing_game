A simple app which implements a 'while loop'. 

It doesn't have the ability to enter a word that is going to be guessed by others...

This app doesn't work on VSC terminal. Error: "Global evaluation requires a thread to have been loaded.".

Download the project, and run (through the Windows CMD) "main.dart" file located inside the "lib" folder.
